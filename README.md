# deepBrain

## 1: Preparing RNA-seq data from Brain tissue for Deep learning applications
# 1.1 Derfinder
1) "windowMat.r" contains all the functions required to RNA-seq preparation (note: this code should be scaled up for running on raijin, including reading files from remote host()
2) "sample_code1.r" contains very basic codes demonstrating "derfinder" mainly

# 1.2 StringTie
1) Using unix-based tool "StringTie"

## 2: Preparing Accetylation data
1) "accetylationDat3.r" is the most efficient code to find binned (specified by a variable, binSize) accetylation data for each chromosome separately, or combined.
