# deepBrain
Deep learning in predicting functional effects of noncoding variants in brain-specific disorders

# Steps:
1. [```Data preprocessing```](https://github.com/Akmazad/deepBrain/tree/master/Data%20Processing) (e.g. RNA-seq, CHIP-seq, ATAC-seq, etc.)
2. [```Data```](https://github.com/Akmazad/deepBrain/tree/master/Data%20Processing#extract-genomic-data-dna-seq-for-non-zero-bins) and [```Label```](https://github.com/Akmazad/deepBrain/blob/master/Data%20Processing/README.md#extract-labels-binary-signals-for-non-zero-bins) extraction
3. [```Numpy conversion```](https://github.com/Akmazad/deepBrain/blob/master/Data%20Processing/split_and_Numpy.py) of data and labels (for DL usage)
4. DL training/Validation/Testing (demonstrated in [```Training 2```](https://github.com/Akmazad/deepBrain/tree/master/Training%202) and [```Training on Google Colab```](https://github.com/Akmazad/deepBrain/tree/master/Training%20on%20Google%20Colab) subdirectories)
